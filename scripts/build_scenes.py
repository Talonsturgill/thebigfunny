# 2026-07-23 "Counting Belugas From Orbit": 7 scenes (S1..S7) onto 11 VO lines.
# S1 L0 (silt/find-the-whale), S2 L1 (331+decline), S3 L2 (from space, SatelliteEye),
# S4 L3-L4 (GAIA+partners, the learning pipeline), S5 L5-L6 (cannot-count-yet, needs a
# clear look), S6 L7-L8 (June 2025 empty, sky booked), S7 L9-L10 (holding on, the question).
# 2026-07-25 "The One It Didn't Hear": 7 scenes (S1..S7) onto 12 VO lines. Shot boundaries
# are anchored to VO LINE STARTS so the picture can never drift from the words (the Gate 0B/0C
# finding that killed the first board: the collapse was spoken at 19.6s and drawn at 33.9s).
# S1 L0-L1 (Otto at work + the second job), S2 L2 (duration lanes + the gate latching),
# S3 L3-L4 (boundary + travel out + THE COLLAPSE), S4 L5 (signature shot + the dark lamp),
# S5 L6-L7 (still heard + by hand + the boulder), S6 L8 (crate + money),
# S7 L9-L11 (wireframe twin + calendar + button).
# 2026-07-26 "The Field That Stopped in 2019": NINE scenes (S1..S9 in Episode.tsx) onto
# 14 VO lines. Shot boundaries are anchored to VO LINE STARTS so the picture can never
# drift from the words. S1 L0 (the letter opens), S2 L1-L2 (the 200 baseline + McCabe's
# fair defense, VOICED not merely posted), S3 L3-L4 (the mouth cranks wide + the intake +
# the burst from the unchanged stem), S4 L5 (the plain letter + 3,048 into one finite
# tape), S5 L6 (three Alaskans reacting three different ways), S6 L7-L8 (the machine opens
# on the capped third pipe + the pawl + the two records), S7 L9-L10 (the arrow on the
# doorless wall + the door swinging free), S8 L11-L12 (NO ALGORITHM + the signature shot),
# S9 L13 (the button, back at the same table, staying interior).
