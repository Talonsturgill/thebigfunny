"""Run-freshness guard: make it physically impossible to ship a PREVIOUS run's scratch.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
out/dispatch/ is gitignored scratch that survives across container sessions.
The pipeline reads and writes artifacts BY PATH, and a stale file at the right
path is byte-for-byte indistinguishable from a fresh one. Two runs have already
been bitten by this:
  - 2026-07-18 found a stale shots.json left over from the 07-17 episode.
  - 2026-07-19 found stale post.txt / sources.json / shots.json / vo_script.json
    left over from a run about an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT story (the Mat-Su AIDEA land
    conveyance). Delivery could have emailed the wrong caption and source list.

The root cause is not "someone forgot to clean up." It is that the pipeline
DRIFTS: newer runs stopped producing some of the old artifacts (they moved to
caption.txt, inline shots, etc.), so those old outputs are never overwritten and
just linger. Any fix that asks every PRODUCER to stamp or register its output
re-introduces exactly this drift problem the next time the pipeline changes.

THE INVARIANT (why this is a real fix and not another sticky note)
------------------------------------------------------------------
A run starts at a recorded instant T. Every artifact this run legitimately
produces is written at or after T. Therefore ANY scratch file with mtime < T is,
by definition, a leftover from an earlier run and must never be trusted.

Freshness is thus a property the filesystem already tracks (mtime), and mtime is
trustworthy here precisely because scratch files are gitignored -- git never
rewrites their timestamps the way it does for checked-out files. No producer has
to change; only:
  1. Phase 0 stamps the run ONCE, before any artifact is produced:
         python3 scripts/run_guard.py init --run-id 2026-07-19
  2. Consumers route their reads through fresh(), which refuses (loudly, with
     both timestamps) anything older than the stamp:
         from run_guard import fresh
         post = open(fresh("out/dispatch/caption.txt")).read()

A missing stamp is also a hard failure: if the run was never stamped we cannot
PROVE a file is fresh, so we refuse rather than guess. The escape hatch for
deliberate manual/standalone use is an explicit opt-out on the consumer
(dispatch_email.py --no-freshness-check), never a silent fallback.
