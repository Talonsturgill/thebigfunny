# Cast & Asset Manifest — The Big Funny engine

The living inventory of everything the Dispatch video engine can draw. **Every run
reads this FIRST and CASTS from this shelf by default** — reuse with fresh staging is
the point of the library (see the library mandate, `prompts/dispatch_routine.md` §4.3a,
rebalanced 2026-07-20). Grow it when a story finds a real gap, and register every
addition here in the same commit. Composition freshness comes from the storyboard
fingerprint + camera + staging, not from re-drawing the cast.

When you add or upgrade an asset, update this file in the same commit. Keep entries
one line: `Name — kind — file — params/poses — status`.

## THE FIXED CAST (The Big Funny) — lib/cast.tsx
REGISTERED 2026-08-01 with the file, in the same commit, per the manifest-drift
rule (two upstream runs failed a gate because an asset existed but was never
registered here).

These are the show's three recurring characters. **They are a LOCK, not a
redraw.** Comedy needs you to already know who is about to speak, so episode
freshness comes from staging, camera and set, never from changing the cast. See
`knowledge/CAST_BIBLE.md`.

- `Ray` — the Id, the engine of the show — cast.tsx — thin identity lock over
  `Character`: flannel, fixed palette, scale 0.96 (deliberately slightly too
  small for the world, the shape-language opposite of the Institution's bulk).
  Default emotion `angry` and default pose `arms-crossed` because his resting
  state at scene start is HAVING ALREADY FOUND OUT; a 60 second episode has no
  room to warm him up. He is RIGHT, never a fool. Exports `RAY_LADDER`
  (angry -> shock -> smug) and `RAY_HERO_POSES` (poses that read at thumbnail,
  which is where the platform decides) — ACTIVE
- `Dee` — the Straight Man — cast.tsx — identity lock over `Character`: vest,
  glasses (the rig's cast-differentiation prop, and she is the one who READ the
  document), scale 1.02, more vertical than Ray. Default emotion `neutral`
  because her comedy is deadpan delivery of something insane and a pre-loaded
  expression spends the crack early. Exports `DEE_CRACK`, the ONE composure
  break allowed per episode; it is a named constant rather than a storyboard
  judgement call so review can grep for it and catch an episode spending it
  twice — ACTIVE
- THE INSTITUTION — **deliberately NOT in cast.tsx**. It is `MachineShadow`, it
  has no face, and it never gets one. A creative gate upstream already rejected
  a cartoon envelope for pulling a face, on the grounds that the gag belonged to
  the institution and not the paper; that ruling is law here. The moment it can
  emote it becomes something you could negotiate with and the premise dies. It
  is re-dressed per episode (insurer, airline, landlord, HR, platform): same
  silhouette, new livery — ACTIVE

## Characters (people)
- `Character` — human rig — Character.tsx — poses: stand/arms-crossed/point/panic/raise (raise NEW 2026-07-20b: one arm thrust high w/ micro-sway, scenes mount a prop at the raised hand); emotions: neutral/angry/worried/shock/smug; outfits: parka/suit/worker/puffer/flannel/vest/referee (referee NEW 2026-07-20b: cream shirt w/ ink official stripes + collar + brass whistle on a lanyard); headgear: bare/beanie/cap/trapper/hood (bands raised off the eyes 2026-07-18b, no more 'burglar mask'); `talking` prop = TalkMouth lip-flap; form-shaded + rim + contact shadow — ACTIVE

## Characterized objects (heroes with a face / bespoke silhouette)
- `ServerMachine` — the data-center/AI antagonist — kit.tsx — emotions: greedy/focused/nervous/shock/ghost; tints: steel/copper; `talking` prop = lip-flap — ACTIVE
- `MachineShadow` — faceless institutional monolith (no face, deliberately cold) — Episode.tsx (2026-07-18) — form-shaded + brushed metal + rim + contact shadow — ACTIVE
- `Sourdough` — NET-NEW 2026-07-19 — personified regional power plant hero, warm/rounded/blocky (deliberate shape-language OPPOSITE of ServerMachine/MachineShadow's cold rectilinear institutions) — kit.tsx — emotions: proud/confident/faltering/frozen; `glow` 0..1 drives his furnace-window-chest emotional tell (dims at a story's turn); `accent` 0..1 for VO-emphasis reactivity; form-shaded + rim + contact shadow — ACTIVE
- `Cell` — NET-NEW 2026-07-19 — battery-storage sidekick on sled runners, a genuine parallel-bet visual (grid-modernization hedge) — kit.tsx — `chargeLevel` 0/1/2 charge-bar face; form-shaded + rim + contact shadow — ACTIVE
- `SatelliteEye` — NET-NEW 2026-07-23 — the imaging-satellite AI-presence hero for "Counting Belugas From Orbit" (NOAA GAIA machine-vision). Deliberate shape language: a compact, boxy, wide-winged, EARNEST little worker looking down at Earth, the opposite of a cold institutional monolith. A single DOWNWARD camera-EYE is the emotional tell (iris dilates while `searching`, squints under `strain`, CLAMPS small+bright when `found` with lock ticks, cyan scanning to amber found). `emotion` searching/straining/found/waiting; `eyeLock` 0..1; `accent` 0..1 VO-reactivity; `scanCone` 0..1 fades a downward imaging cone; `strain` 0..1 a comic squint + faint sweat bead (satellite only, NEVER the whale). Indigo solar wings w/ cell grid + sun-glint, high-gain dish, blinking lights, thruster nozzles. Built to the depth bar (tones/FormGradient/RimLight/ContactShadow) with idle bob + blink + panel shimmer — kit.tsx — ACTIVE
- `Petrel` — NET-NEW 2026-07-24 — the SAR "drone-in-a-box" hero for "The Box That Waits for You". Deliberate shape language: small, ROUNDED, WARM-cream helper (opposite of a cold institutional monolith), genuinely capable but INCOMPLETE without the pilot. Single teal thermal camera-EYE is the emotional tell. Signature interaction DEFER-TO-THE-HAND: `heading` leans/faces the drone toward a pointed direction; idle-searching drifts to the WRONG side, then SNAPS to `heading`. `emotion` cocky/eager/lost/purposeful/deferential; `eyeDilate` 0..1 (wide search -> clamped lock, with lock ticks); `accent` VO-reactivity; `heading` deg; `groundY` contact shadow. Built to the depth bar (tones/FormGradient/RimLight/ContactShadow, idle bob + blink + rotor spin) — kit.tsx — ACTIVE
- `PetrelDock` — NET-NEW 2026-07-24 — the cold slate "drone-in-a-box" the industry ships (quarantined blue-gray, rectilinear, the deliberate opposite of Petrel's warm roundness); `lidOpen` 0..1 tips the hinged lid, Petrel rises out of it in the hook + button — kit.tsx — ACTIVE
- `Vale` — NET-NEW 2026-07-20 — the GUARDIAN autonomous wildfire-response drone (hero). Deliberate shape language: rounded/symmetric/protective gunmetal machine, the opposite of the fire's chaos AND the ServerMachine's greed. A single expressive camera-EYE is the emotional tell (iris dilates scanning, CLAMPS small+bright on a lock, with lock ticks); quad rotor arms with spinning blur discs, a suppressant-tank belly with a fill gauge, landing skids, blinking running lights. `emotion` vigilant/locked/resolute/calm; `eyeLock` 0..1; `accent` reactive; `groundY` draws a contact shadow when landed; idle hover-bob + blink. Built to the depth bar (tones/FormGradient/RimLight/ContactShadow) — kit.tsx — ACTIVE

## Craft advance this run (2026-07-19): every claim/format/story is a "live, tested run", not a batch script
- Fixed two real infrastructure bugs discovered while producing this run's VO (both would recur on EVERY future dispatch with numbers/dates in the script, not just this one): `scripts/vo_soundcheck.py`'s WER canonicalizer silently dropped `$`/`%` symbols and mis-split comma-grouped numbers (inflated WER on every number-heavy script); `scripts/vo_synth_gemini.py`'s `_align_wholefile` (a) passed the script's own opening words as Whisper's `initial_prompt`, which made Whisper hallucinate-skip the real audio matching it (reproduced: dropped the first ~14.6s of a real take), and (b) collapsed multi-word token expansions to word[0] only, desyncing the alignment arrays. Both fixed; see the scripts' own comments for the reproduction notes.

## Sensors (the instrument family) — lib/sensors.tsx
REGISTERED 2026-07-25 (this file existed since 2026-07-21c but was NEVER registered here, so two
runs of Gate 0D could not find its assets. That is the manifest-drift bug this run fixed.)
- `SatelliteEye` — the ORBITAL EYE — sensors.tsx — NOTE: a second copy also lives in kit.tsx. Prefer the sensors.tsx one; the duplicate is a known hazard (see UPGRADE_BACKLOG).
- `ListeningMooring` — the SEAFLOOR EAR, passive-acoustic node — sensors.tsx — anchor base, ribbed cylinder, mint hydrophone dome, tether float; `detect` 0..1 blooms sonar rings — ACTIVE
- `SeismicStation` — NET-NEW 2026-07-25 — the GROUND EAR, hero of "The One It Didn't Hear". The shelf had an orbital eye and a seafloor ear but nothing that listens to the GROUND. Deliberate shape language: SOFT ROUND INSTRUMENT against HARD ANGULAR LAND. THE TELL IS A BRASS GRAMOPHONE HORN built as a real cone in 3/4 (straight taper walls, hollow dark mouth, rolled rim, receding interior throat rings) — pass 1 drew it as a flat face-on ellipse and it read as a lollipop. `emotion` listening (lazy quarter-turn sweeps) / straining (telescopes out past comfort, rim trembles, stress lines) / missing (horn rolls down to point at the dirt, rim dented, lamp DARK) / heard (snaps rigid, rim flares, lamp fires amber with sound arcs arriving into the mouth). Also has a real FACE (brow bar that drops, two lidded eyes with highlights that TRACK via `look`, desynced blink) — pass 1 had no face and read inert. `lamp` 0..1 lights ONLY when emotion==='heard', so a lit lamp always means a detection actually fired. `heading` deg, `accent` VO-reactivity, `groundY`, `tint` so a night palette re-tints without a re-draw. Solar-panel brim, stub antenna with secondary sway, ribbed half-buried post, vent slots, bezel ticks, hard angular dirt collar. Form-shaded + rim + contact shadow — ACTIVE
- Look-dev: `StationLook` (StationLook.tsx) — the four emotional states plus NightGrade, in one frame.

## Paper & records (the interior family) — lib/paper.tsx + lib/records.tsx
NET-NEW 2026-07-26 ("The Field That Stopped in 2019"). The shelf had ELEVEN biomes and every
one was outdoors, and materials.tsx had eight substance overlays and none was paper. This
dispatch happens entirely inside an office, so both gaps were load-bearing.
- `PaperOfficeBG` — the library's FIRST INTERIOR BIOME — paper.tsx — a fluorescent-lit records
  room: a back wall of filing cabinets in one-point recession (THE DARK ANCHOR, #4A5A66), a lit
  dust column, a desk plane, and a front parallax drift of loose sheets. Params `parallax`,
  `drift`. Built against a HIGH flatness rating with an ENFORCED value ladder (10 to 12 percent L
  per depth plane) because a high-key flat-lit cream interior is the textbook beige-page recipe — ACTIVE
- `PaperFiber` — the paper SUBSTANCE (the materials.tsx gap) — paper.tsx — fiber tooth plus a pale
  ruled grid so a sheet reads as printed stock, deterministic imul hash, never Math.random — ACTIVE
- `Sheet` — a sheet with REAL BODY — paper.tsx — the numeric shadow contract lives in code, not in
  prose: 2px edge, drop shadow offset 4 down / 2 right at 22 percent, optional curled corner with a
  30 percent under-shadow. Under flat light this is what makes paper read as a solid — ACTIVE
- `TaperedCone` — the TRUE THREE-QUARTER CONE — paper.tsx — REBUILT IN PASS 2 after the panel
  raised it as a hard blocker. Pass 1 drew a dark ellipse at FULL mouth width over the body and the
  whole thing read as a black satellite dish, which is the SAME lollipop failure the 2026-07-25
  SeismicStation horn hit. The fix is three things: a much flatter rim ellipse so the camera looks
  ALONG the cone rather than down into a dish, a dark interior INSET and pushed down the throat so a
  lit rim band and both straight taper walls stay visible, and the two walls drawn as SEPARATE lit
  and shaded faces, which is what actually sells a cone when there is no dramatic falloff to help.
  `mouthW` and `stemW` are independent on purpose — ACTIVE
- `StateLetter` — the letter, WITH NO FACE — paper.tsx — a creative gate ruled the first pass a
  violation: a cartoon envelope performing a wince is a gag played BY the object that carried a
  citizenship challenge to thousands of real people. Reluctance now lives entirely in PHYSICS, an
  `open` flap that hesitates against the paper's own stiffness and flips up about its hinge. Params
  `open`, `line`, `faceDown` — ACTIVE
- `FullTapeMachine` — fixed-capacity answering machine — paper.tsx — two visible reels, a finite
  tape loop, a FULL tag on a spring. Exists so a COUNT can be felt against a KNOWN OBJECT WITH FIXED
  CAPACITY instead of as a ratio, which is how this film honoured a ban on dividing two figures that
  were different kinds of object. `fill` 0..1 seizes the reels — ACTIVE
- `RecordsMachine` — the run's HERO — records.tsx — ONE machine, not two, so its output stem has an
  antecedent before the narration references it. The intake mouth cranks wider tooth by tooth via
  `mouthOpen` while the stem never changes width, which is the entire thesis in two independent
  parameters. `strain` pops rivets one at a time and pins a pressure gauge, so the stem's refusal is
  STAGED AS MOTION rather than declared as an absence — ACTIVE
- `ThreePipeCutaway` — the SAME machine, opened — records.tsx — the thesis drawn as a physical
  ABSENCE. Pipe one inbound and pipe two outbound are fat and working; pipe three, which would carry
  a naturalization certificate back in, ENDS IN CAPPED OPEN AIR with certificates dropping onto a
  drift pile. `disclose` staggers the reveal so the capped pipe is the LAST information; `lock`
  slams a pawl onto the date wheel. KNOWN WEAKNESS: two panel judges found the capped pipe still not
  legible enough as an absence at sampled frames. Next pass should scale the pipes up, label the
  capped end, and animate flow in one and two so the dead one reads by contrast — ACTIVE

## Fauna (the Alaska bestiary) — lib/fauna.tsx
- `Moose` — land — fauna.tsx — emotion: calm/wary; idle head-bob/ear-flick/tail; palmate antlers; form-shaded + rim + AO — NEW 2026-07-18; `bumpKick` 0..1 NEW 2026-07-19: a comic bumped-indignant-recover reaction pose (squash-and-stagger, pinned ears, wide indignant eyes, antler wobble, impact stars); `alert` 0..1 NEW 2026-07-20: ears perk fully UP+forward, head/neck RAISES, nostril-flare sniff, pupil tracks upward — the OPPOSITE motion from bumpKick's lateral recoil (a watching-the-sky pose), used for the drone-watcher gag — existing-asset new-pose growth quota
- `Raven` — air/perch — fauna.tsx — mode: perch/fly; head-tilt, throat hackles, wing-beat cycle — NEW 2026-07-18
- `BaldEagle` — air — fauna.tsx — soaring, fingered primaries, white head/tail, yellow beak — NEW 2026-07-18
- `Salmon` — water — fauna.tsx — SOCKEYE v3, REBUILT 2026-07-21 (fish-mastery session) on the shared lib/fishcraft.tsx realism engine (owner: "salmon are silver and scaly and shiny... master the fish artwork"): ocean phase = CHROME default hero look (countershade ramp, shingle scales, faded spec band + hard glint, iridescence, belly bounce), spawning = scarlet body + olive head + male hump/kype via `kype` 0..1, drab unspotted tail; carangiform traveling-wave swim (`swim` 0..1), gill pulse, rippling fin membranes, `caustics`. Taste-looped 8 rounds — ACTIVE
- `Coho` — water — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-21 (fish-mastery): the silver salmon; ocean = brilliant chrome w/ small black spots on back + UPPER tail lobe only (the coho tell), spawning = dark olive head/back + maroon flanks + modest hump; white gum line detail; fishcraft engine — ACTIVE
- `RainbowTrout` — water — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-21 (fish-mastery): olive back, THE pink lateral stripe + rosy cheek, 46 deterministic small black spots above the line + spotted dorsal/adipose/BOTH tail lobes, squared spotted tail, small mouth ending under the eye; fishcraft engine — ACTIVE
- `Halibut` — water — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-21 (fish-mastery): Pacific halibut, right-eyed flatfish side-on; elongated-diamond camo body w/ deterministic mottle, BOTH eyes stacked on the eyed side, undulating tapered dorsal+anal fin fringes (the swim), broad crescent tail, high-arched lateral line over the pectoral; `swim`, `caustics` — ACTIVE
- `Grizzly` — land — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-20c (asset-library session, UPGRADE #2): purpose-built anatomy PER STANCE (all4: horizontal bulk, hump highest, head slung forward; stand: upright pear-trunk tower, planted hinds, dangling clawed forepaws; fish: head dropped to the waterline + water hint); emotion calm/alert; roar 0..1 head-throw + jaw; breath/sway/ear idles; fur break-up detail; form-shaded + rim + AO. Taste-looped twice (v1 potato-pose redone). fish stance not yet frame-checked — verify before first on-air use — ACTIVE
- `Caribou` — land — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-20c (asset-library session #2): barren-ground caribou, lighter/leggier than the moose; species reads = pale chest mane + tall C-swept beam antlers w/ forward brow shovel (1.55x, sized in taste pass 2) + pale muzzle + dark socks; `trot` 0..1 diagonal-pair trot with head pump over graze idle; emotion calm/wary; form-shaded + rim + AO. Scatter at depth for a herd — ACTIVE
- `Orca` — water — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-20c (asset-library session #2): killer whale; species reads = TALL upright dorsal blade (rebuilt in taste pass 2 from a stub) + bold white eye patch + white belly sweep + gray saddle; `surface` 0..1 arcs a porpoising breach w/ blowhole spray; swim undulation, sculling pectoral, fluke follow-through; form-shaded + rim — ACTIVE
- `Puffin` — air/coastal — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-20c (asset-library session #2): horned puffin, upright tuxedo build (big head, short body = endearing); white face disc + oversized orange/yellow parrot bill + orange feet; `flap` 0..1 fast wing whirr; waddle-shift + head-tilt + blink idles; cleared taste loop first pass — ACTIVE
- `Wolf` — land — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-20c: gray wolf, level topline + deep chest, grizzled saddle BAND (taste pass 2: v1's saddle read as a crater), straight bushy tail (the wolf tell), cream legs/belly, amber eyes; `howl` 0..1 (muzzle skyward, closed eye, open throat, breath puff), `stalk` 0..1 (head below shoulder, crouch, ears pinned), emotion calm/alert; breath/ear-swivel/tail idles — ACTIVE
- `RedFox` — land — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-20c: flame-red coat, black stockings + ear tips, white bib/cheek/tail-tip (diagnostic), huge radar ears, near-body-length lush tail; `pounce` 0..1 arcs the full mouse-jump (crouch -> vault -> nose-down dive); light-bounce/ear-radar/tail-curl idles; cleared taste loop first pass (best first-pass of the session) — ACTIVE

- `Ptarmigan` — land/alpine — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-20c: the state bird; `season` winter (all-white + black tail edge + red eye comb) / summer (mottled brown); feathered snowshoe feet; pecking-bob + head-jerk idles; `flush` 0..1 startle wing-burst w/ snow poof; cleared first pass — ACTIVE
- `KingCrab` — water/comic — fauna.tsx — NET-NEW 2026-07-20c: Bering Sea money crab; spiky carmine carapace, googly eyestalks, one OVERSIZED snapping right claw (`clawSnap`), six wave-phase scuttle legs (`scuttle`); cleared first pass — ACTIVE

### Bestiary gaps
NONE. The 2026-07-20 library session banked all 14 gap species + SledDogTeam promotion (21 fauna assets total). Future growth is story-driven (new poses on existing cast count).

## Props & set pieces
- `AlaskaMini` — map of Alaska w/ pulsing pin — kit.tsx — ACTIVE
- `TallyCounter` — NET-NEW 2026-07-20b ("The Referee Arrives") — the MECHANICAL count mark: `variant="clicker"` (hand-held brass dial, needle whirls w/ `spin` 0..1 and hard-locks, count window, optional swinging `tag`) / `variant="odometer"` (mounted brass chip, cream flip-digits, `roll` 0..1 animates the ones digit; rest-digit display bug fixed same run) — props.tsx — deliberately a physical object you could HOLD, never a HUD reticle; form-shaded + rim + contact shadow — ACTIVE
- `VideoWeir` — NET-NEW 2026-07-20b — the tribal camera-lane weir set piece: warm timber A-frame legs w/ pegs, plank walkway w/ grain, picket lane guides, camera housing w/ blinking rec light, mounted TallyCounter odometer; `plant` 0..1 drops it in with a settle; fisheries-monitoring stage for any future salmon/counting story — props.tsx — ACTIVE
- SHARED PROPS KIT — lib/props.tsx — NEW 2026-07-20d: the episode-local props generalized with ALL story copy as params (a prop with baked-in text is an episode-local, not a library asset): `StatCard` (big stat chip, tintable), `Nameplate` (identity plate), `SwingSign` (hanging sign, 1-3 lines, pivot bug fixed), `GearLever` (pulled 0..1 + optional DENIED badge), `SurveyStake` (settle drop-in), `MeasuringChain` (pays out + distance tag), `PenAndDocument` (pen hovers trembling, never signs; optional party plate), `TrailPost` (two-line sign), `BoundaryReveal` (glowing boundary traces any closed path `d` + optional town marker) — look-dev in PropsShowcase.tsx — ACTIVE
  - Episode.tsx copies remain episode-local history; new scenes import from lib/props.tsx.
- `BoxLabel` / `StatBurst` / `FatArrow` / `Stamp` — HUD/label kit — kit.tsx — ACTIVE
  - NOTE: these HUD chips still render as flat fills over the lit world (flagged by the
    scorer panel 2026-07-18). Next craft-advance: give the label/chip kit form-shading + a
    drop shadow so overlays sit IN the lit scene, not on top of it.

## Vehicles (the Alaska machine kit) — lib/vehicles.tsx (NEW 2026-07-20c, asset-library session #2)
- `BushPlane` — air/ground/water — vehicles.tsx — high-wing taildragger (Super Cub silhouette); `mode` ground (tundra tires, slow prop) / fly (prop blur disc, bank bob) / float (pontoons, heave); airfoil wing slab + lift struts, real rudder blade (both from taste pass 2), cabin glass, engine cowl, N-number panel N907AK, rivets; `propSpeed` override; `body` tint — ACTIVE

## Look-dev harnesses
- `CraftShowcase` — motion/voice/SFX-era look-dev comp (entrance, followThrough, TalkMouth ramp, talking cast) — CraftShowcase.tsx — NEW 2026-07-18b
- `FishShowcase` — FishShowcase.tsx — NEW 2026-07-21: the fish-mastery audition sheet (sockeye/coho ocean+spawn, rainbow trout, halibut, chrome hero); render a still before an episode uses a species
- `CityShowcase` — CityShowcase.tsx — NEW 2026-07-21: AnchorageSkylineBG audition (fall + Denali + floatplane + railroad + trail moose)

## Environments
- `DawnForestBG` — boreal birch/spruce dawn, parallax treeline, mist, birds, ground gradient, form-shaded trunks + bark texture + foliage speckle — Episode.tsx (2026-07-18) — ACTIVE
- `FrostYardBG` — NET-NEW 2026-07-19 — interior powerplant-yard/dusk biome: parallax mist/gust bands, flickering skyline windows, drifting snow particles, `parallax` prop for depth-of-field scene layering — Episode.tsx — ACTIVE
- `NenanaRangeBG` — NET-NEW 2026-07-20 — boreal AIRSTRIP biome (distinct from DawnForestBG's full forest and FrostYardBG's utility yard): a flat man-made tarmac foreground with a painted runway centerline + receding blue edge lights to a vanishing point, fronted by a LOW distant black-spruce band (3-4 parallax sub-bands = the supporting aerial-depth refinement), under a boreal midnight-blue -> rose-gold sky. `dawn` 0..1 warms night->sunrise; `parallax` DOF; `showStrip`; dawn-mist drift + fading stars (second disjoint motion region) — Episode.tsx — ACTIVE
- `AuroraNightBG` — NET-NEW 2026-07-20c (asset-library session #2, lib/biomes.tsx — the SHARED biome home; episode-locals stay in Episode.tsx): the night/aurora rig ("known next advance" since 07-18, now built).

THE stage for climate/ice stories — ACTIVE
- `RiverBG` — NET-NEW 2026-07-20d (lib/biomes.tsx): Interior braided river built off ONE parametric centerline (channel, gravel margins, flow-aligned braid-bar island, current lines, riffle sparkle all share it — nothing floats or lands off the water), mottled vegetated banks (never flat fills), bank spruces scaling toward the viewer, distant snow-patched range + drifting clouds; params `season` summer/fall (fall adds red dwarf-birch shrubs), `riffle`. THE salmon-story stage (pair with Salmon, Grizzly 'fish', FishingBoat) — ACTIVE
- `MainStreetBG` — NET-NEW 2026-07-20d (lib/biomes.tsx): small-town main street in one-point perspective: false-front storefronts converging both sides (camera-facing lit faces with door/shop window/sign + shadow-side walls), gravel road with center dashes + puddle shimmer, power poles with sagging wires, pennant string fluttering across the street, snow-capped massif closing the view; params `dusk` 0..1 (dusk sky + per-window warm flicker), `banner`.

- `AnchorageSkylineBG` — NET-NEW 2026-07-21 (lib/biomes.tsx, owner directive "bake the Anchorage skyline in as an artifact"): the verified local-recognition postcard, drawn back-to-front per docs/craft/ANCHORAGE_LANDMARKS.md: sky, tiny lone Denali (`denali`), Mt. Susitna "Sleeping Lady" reclining ridge, continuous faceted Chugach wall w/ termination-dust caps + Flattop + foothill treeline, downtown band on the bluff (ConocoPhillips + Atwood slabs, Hotel Captain Cook three stepped mustard towers), Cook Inlet water w/ wobble reflections, coastal-trail foreground (railing, path, alders, fireweed); params `season` summer/fall, `denali`, `floatplane` (animated Lake Hood red/white floatplane), `train` (blue/gold Alaska Railroad consist).

  - Environment kit now ELEVEN biomes (three episode-local + eight shared in lib/biomes.tsx). Every biome candidate from the upgrade backlog is now BUILT.
  - Local-flavor reference docs (NEW 2026-07-21): docs/craft/ANCHORAGE_LANDMARKS.md (skyline formula + insider props + usage rules) and docs/craft/ALASKA_NOSTALGIA.md (top-12 local-grin list, bygone businesses, famous Alaskans w/ sensitivity rules, historic eras, trademark homage-not-copy guide). Consult BOTH in the directors room when a story is set in/near Anchorage or wants a nostalgia beat.

## Engine systems (the craft layer — advance these every run, don't just consume them)
- `lib/fishcraft.tsx` — FISHCRAFT (NET-NEW 2026-07-21, fish-mastery session): the shared fish-realism engine every fauna fish composes (doctrine + research sources in docs/craft/FISHCRAFT.md). `makeSpine()` carangiform traveling wave (amplitude grows tailward, head counter-yaw, tail heave+pitch coupling so the figure-8 emerges, gill pulse, buoyancy bob on irrational periods), `bodyGeom()` sampled outline/rails from depth profiles (SINGLE closed subpath — two concatenated subpaths auto-close with chord artifacts), `FishSurface` chrome layer stack (countershade gradient, masked shingle scales, filled form-shadow band, head-to-tail FADED spec band + hard glint, iridescence puddle, belly bounce, caustics), `FinMembrane` translucent rippling ray-lined fins, `CHROME_SKIN` preset. HARD-WON RULES: uid() inputs must include ALL variant props (pure-hash collisions cross-wire gradients); spec layers fade out before the caudal wrist; body profiles keep a wrist FLOOR (~9% body length) — ACTIVE
- `lib/materials.tsx` — MATERIALS (NEW 2026-07-20d, Stage3D backlog item (d)): surfaces read as SUBSTANCES, not flat fills. Eight deterministic SVG-pattern overlays: brushedMetal, corrugated, tarmac, granite, bark, planks, snowpack, ice. Usage: `<MaterialDefs />` once per svg, then re-draw any silhouette with `fill={matFill('bark')}` over its lit base (or the `Surface` helper). Seeded imul-hash speckle (no Math.random). Look-dev: MaterialShowcase.tsx incl. an Extrude+material demo. Pairs with the no-flat-single-tone-fills rule.
- `lib/motion.tsx` — animation principles: entrance() (anticipation/overshoot/squash-stretch + MotionBlur velocity), followThrough() secondary swing, accentKick(), idleSway(), squashStretch(), ChipShadow (HUD chips sit in the scene) — NEW 2026-07-18b
- `lib/motion.tsx` `vitals()` — THE LIVING-IDLE PRIMITIVE, 2026-07-26 (repeat-offender fix: the
  scorer panel flagged thin idle life on held heroes on 2026-07-24 AND 2026-07-25, and both runs
  DEFERRED it, so the third strike gets a code guard instead of a doctrine note). The Character rig
  had already earned a layered weight-shift idle, but every characterized-object hero floated on a
  SINGLE fixed-period sine (`const bob = 5 * Math.sin(f / 17)`) — which is exactly why they read
  mechanical: over any half-second window the figure barely moves, and two heroes on screen bob in
  lockstep. `vitals(frame, phase, gain)` returns `{bob, swayX, breath, tilt, micro}` from three
  desynced layers on deliberately IRRATIONAL period ratios (no common multiple, so the loop never
  re-phases and never reads as a loop); `phase` decorrelates instances by the golden angle, `gain`
  scales or freezes the whole signal (0 = a deliberate held-breath story beat). WIRED THROUGH every
  hero already: kit.tsx `Sourdough` (frozen still holds its breath), `Cell`, `Vale`, `SatelliteEye`,
  `Petrel`; sensors.tsx `SatelliteEye`, `SeismicStation`. Author new heroes against it — a hero
  cannot be given a thin idle without deliberately bypassing the primitive. Verified: tsc --noEmit
  clean + StationLook draft stills render all four emotional states correctly — ACTIVE
- `lib/voice.tsx` — VOICE ACTING: VoiceProvider/useVoice (per-frame mouth envelope + emphasis accents from the VO pipeline), TalkMouth flapping mouth; Character + ServerMachine take `talking` — the cast speaks/reacts in sync with the narration — NEW 2026-07-18b
- `assets/sfx/` designed-foley bank (scripts/build_sfx_library.py, 16 sounds; scripts/sfx_bank.py resolver; drop real CC0 takes in assets/sfx/real/ to upgrade any entry) — NEW 2026-07-18b
- `scripts/render.sh` — draft (half-res ~2-4x faster) vs final render wrapper; the taste loop iterates on drafts — NEW 2026-07-18b
- `lib/lighting.tsx` — tones() ramps, FormGradient, RimLight, ContactShadow, BrushedMetal/BarkTexture/FoliageSpeckle, GradeLayer (bloom+vignette+grain), MotionBlur (180° anisotropic) — NEW 2026-07-18; `HazeOverlay` NEW 2026-07-19 — translucent grid-textured animated air-quality/pollution grading layer (`amount` 0..1 drives wash + tint + grid opacity), for a story's environmental-stakes turn
- `lib/FX.tsx` — SpeedLines, ImpactStar, PaperStorm, ZoomVignette; `SmellRings` NEW 2026-07-20 (radial VOC/smoke detection rings emanating from a sensor node, radial-emanate motion) + `ScanReticle` NEW 2026-07-20 (thermal-lock targeting reticle: rotating corner brackets that SNAP inward and clamp on a target, `lock` 0..1) — ACTIVE
- `lib/lighting.tsx` CRAFT ADVANCE 2026-07-20: `IRVision` — a reusable false-color THERMAL/IR heat-vision look system (magenta->coral->citron heat ramp centered on the hot target + sensor scanlines + refresh sweep + a boxed THERMAL HUD tag), `amount` 0..1 crossfades the drone's-eye view in. Any future sensor/thermal/IR Alaska story inherits it. The run's SINGLE primary craft advance (atmospheric-perspective aerial-depth treeline in NenanaRangeBG is a supporting refinement).
- `lib/stage3d.tsx` — TRUE 2.5D ENGINE (NEW 2026-07-20, UPGRADE_BACKLOG #1 prototype). A real shared
  virtual camera via CSS 3D perspective (`Stage3D`: dolly/truck/boom/orbit/roll), depth layers with
  automatic perspective parallax + overscan (`Plane`), solid extruded dimensional forms (`Extrude`),
  and projected ground cast-shadows (`CastShadow3D`). Proof scenes in `TwentyFiveD.tsx` (comp
  `TwentyFiveD` vs flat `BorealFlat`). NOT yet wired into the Episode pipeline; see UPGRADE_BACKLOG.md
  for the migration plan (per-face Extrude shading + a Character/kit adapter, then migrate one scene).
- `lib/stage3d.tsx` UPGRADES 2026-07-20b: Extrude now has a REAL per-face light model (side wall
  responds to the live camera orbit under the fixed screen-left key, back-slice AO); new `Atmosphere`
  (per-plane aerial perspective: desaturate + contrast-loss + sky veil with depth); new `Solidify` +
  `Card` asset adapter (ANY existing kit hero gains real body thickness with zero re-authoring:
  darkened copies stacked in Z behind the lit front face). Proven in `Nenana3D.tsx` (comp `Nenana3D`),
  the VERTICAL SLICE: Vale on a TRUE 3D runway floor (rotateX'd ground plane, supersampled 2x so the
  perspective-stretched tarmac stays crisp), camera cranes down through the treeline, flies low over
  the runway, rises with the liftoff.
- `lib/lighting.tsx` NIGHTGRADE — 2026-07-25 CRAFT ADVANCE (the run's single primary engine advance).
  Every prior Dispatch was a daylight or dusk world. The engine had AuroraNightBG (one specific night
  BIOME) but no general system for making ANY biome read as night with rationed practical light.
  `NightGrade(f, color, amount, floor, horizon, sources[])` does four things GradeLayer cannot:
  (1) an ambient cold cast so the world sits in one coherent night, (2) a BLACK FLOOR that crushes
  shadows toward true black so "unlit" is a different STATE from "dimly lit", (3) SOURCE BLOOM emitted
  ONLY at declared `sources` {x,y,r,color,intensity} — a scene must REGISTER a light before it can glow,
  which makes a palette rule like "amber never appears on an unmonitored slope" a property of the scene
  graph instead of a convention a renderer can violate silently, and (4) a horizon lift so ridge
  silhouettes still separate at the black floor. Look-dev: StationLook.tsx.
- KNOWN NEXT ADVANCES (2026-07-26 panel, median 6.68 vs a 9.0 bar, worth reading before the next run):
  held figures render FROZEN across full 8-frame strips even though the Character rig has idle built
  in, so scenes are not driving it; the turn's arrow arrives and never crumples; nine shots played at
  ONE camera height on one set with no close-up and no scale change; and the caption_fixups map in
  vo_script.json must be populated EVERY run or TTS spellings like 'D M V' paint onto screen.
- Known next advances: migrate MORE Episode scenes onto stage3d (first landed 2026-07-20b: the
  boom-up crane in "The Referee Arrives"; lesson: overscan non-fill world planes well past the
  frame at max pull-back or they render as cut-out boxes), kinetic typography, per-material
  texture library, night/aurora lighting. PANEL-BACKED BACKLOG (2026-07-20b, first-time
  deferrals with plans in docs/RUN_UPGRADES.md): fauna Salmon spine-follow swim deform;
  Character rig micro-texture pass behind a `detail` prop; word-level kinetic captions driven
  by words.json.
